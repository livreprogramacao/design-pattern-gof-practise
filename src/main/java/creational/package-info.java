/**
 * GoF Creational Design Patterns
 * <p>
 * Creational design patterns are concerned with the way objects are created. These patterns
 * are used when a decision must be made at the time a class is instantiated. Typically, the
 * details of the concrete class that is to be instantiated are hidden from (and unknown
 * to) the calling class by an abstract class that knows only about the abstract class or the
 * </p>
 * interface it implements. The following creational patterns are described by the GoF:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Abstract Factory
 * <li> Builder
 * <li> Factory Method
 * <li> Prototype
 * <li> Singleton
 * </ul>
