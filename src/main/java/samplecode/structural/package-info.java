/**
 * GoF Structural Design Patterns
 * <p>
 * Structural patterns are concerned with composition or the organization of classes
 * and objects, how classes inherit from each other, and how they are composed from
 * other classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Common Structural patterns include Adapter, Proxy, and Decorator patterns.
 * These patterns are similar in that they introduce a level of indirection between a client
 * class and a class it wants to use. Their intents are different, however. Adapter uses
 * indirection to modify the interface of a class to make it easier for a client class to use
 * it. Decorator uses indirection to add behavior to a class, without unduly affecting the
 * client class. Proxy uses indirection transparently to provide a stand-in for another class.
 * </p>
 * The following Structural patterns are described by GoF:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Adapter
 * <li> Bridge
 * <li> Composite
 * <li> Decorator
 * <li> Facade
 * <li> Flyweight
 * <li> Proxy
 * </ul>
